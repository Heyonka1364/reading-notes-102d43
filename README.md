Hi, my name is Jared Plummer.

**Growth Mindset**

- *Never* compare yourself to others becasue you might be starting at a different spot than them 

- *Always* remember to give your brain a break 

- *Failure* is something to be prepared for and grow from 

>A few modern philosophers assert that an individualâ€™s intelligence is a fixed 
quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react 
against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all, 
method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement 
and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. ~ALFRED BINET

# Markdown

Markdown is a simpler version of HTML. It syntax is much different. Markdown uses symbols to achive differernt formats.

For example, to create the Markdown header, you would need to type \# Markdown

Matkdown is able to create many different things for example, Markdown can make list. The syntax for a list would be a dash then a space the any text in that order.
You can see an example of this further down when we start talking about the formats of text. 

Markdown is also capable of showcasing bold, italized, and a combination of the all of them.

- Bold letters would be two asterix on both side of selected text
- Italic letter would be one asterix on both side of selected text
- Bold and Italic letters would be three asterix on both side of selected text and one underscore on both sides of selected text

See example in order below

**Insert Text**

*Insert Text*

***insert _text_ here***

Moving on to images. Images can really pull a website together and with Markdown we can pull images from all over the internet.

The syntax for an image would be *![This is not an image](insert image address)*. 

You can make the text anything you want and the text will show up as the url link on your website.

And then we learned how to link a url link and attach it to our website. 

The code for that would be *[Insert text](insert url link)*. 

You can make the text anything you want and the text will show up as the url link on your website. 

The link to my portfolio down below is a perfect example of what it should look like.
