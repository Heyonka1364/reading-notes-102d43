Hi, my name is Jared Plummer.

**Growth Mindset**

- *Never* compare yourself to others becasue you might be starting at a different spot than them 

- *Always* remember to give your brain a break 

- *Failure* is something to be prepared for and grow from 

>A few modern philosophers assert that an individualâ€™s intelligence is a fixed 
quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react 
against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all, 
method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement 
and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. ~ALFRED BINET
