Hi, my name is Jared Plummer.

**Growth Mindset**

- *Never* compare yourself to others becasue you might be starting at a different spot than them 

- *Always* remember to give your brain a break 

- *Failure* is something to be prepared for and grow from 

>A few modern philosophers assert that an individualâ€™s intelligence is a fixed 
quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react 
against this brutal pessimism... With practice, training, and above all, 
method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement 
and literally to become more intelligent than we were before. ~ALFRED BINET

# Markdown

Markdown is a simpler version of HTML. It syntax is much different. Markdown uses symbols to achive differernt formats.

For example, to create the Markdown header, you would need to type \# Markdown

Markdown is also capable of showcasing letters size, bold, italized, and a combination of the all of them.

- Bold letters would be \**Insert Text**. Two asterix on both side of selected text
- Italic letter would be \*Insert Text* One asterix on both side of selected text
- Letter size or sub text would be \*<sub>Insert text</sub>.
- Bold and Italic letters would be \***insert _text_ here***. Three asterix on both side of selected text and one underscore on both sides of selected text

See example in order below

**Insert Text**

*Insert Text*

<sub>Insert text</sub>

***insert _text_ here***
